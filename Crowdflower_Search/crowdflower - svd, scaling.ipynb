Finn's grandma, Hy (Ellen Burstyn), lives with her great aunt, Glady Jo (Anne Bancroft), at their idyllic Northern California home. The two fiery women meet with seven older female relatives and close friends for a regular quilting bee, led by Anna (Maya Angelou). Over the course of the summer, Finn contemplates her future while gaining insight into love and relationships from the different members of the quilting bee. Their experiences are brought to life as each woman shares a unique tale with the confused young woman. The interwoven memories of each sage member of the quilting bee--including Constance (Kate Nelligan); Anna's daughter, Mariana (Alfre Woodard); and Finn's free-spirited mother, Sally (Kate Capshaw)--become lessons in love, pain, and emotional growth for Finn as the women work to make her wedding quilt. Each memory becomes a vivid flashback subtly weaving the past and present together to create a colorful collection of stories, featuring young stars including Claire Danes and Samantha Mathis as the individual women in their youth. A tribute to women's friendship and camaraderie, HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT shines with a cast of all-star actresses.\",\n",

Wall Clock is bringing back the classic design with a solid hardwood case in a timeless brown cherry finish. Faux leather inserts are complemented by contrast stitching. A metal cage protects the glass lens (presumably from flying dodge balls). This clock uses Quartz movement and requires one AA battery (not included.)\\n\\nAbout Bulova Corporation\\nThe realization of a great American dream began in 1875 when Joseph Bulova, a 23-year-old immigrant from Bohemia, opened a small jewelry store on Malden Lane in New York City. This modest enterprise was to evolve into one of today's preeminent watch and clock companies. In 1911, Bulova began manufacturing boudoir and desk clocks, along with fine pocket watches, which he made and sold in unprecedented numbers. During World War I, wristwatches were issued in the military for their greater convenience. Returning veterans brought home the new fashion - and a new market emerged.\\n\\nBulova timepieces use only the finest materials, precision, craftsmanship, and state-of-the-art technology for enduring quality and performance. At the heart of each Bulova watch is precision accuracy. From the finest quartz movements to alternative technologies such as solar or mechanical energy, each Bulova watch is guaranteed to be accurate to within one minute a year. Every Bulova is anti-magnetic, shock-resistant, and features the company's unique distortion-free and scratch-resistant Dura-Crystal.\\n\\nOnly Bulova offers the range of styling and the scope of products to meet everyone's needs. From the sporty Marine Star Collection to diamond watches and heirloom-quality timepieces, Bulova has a watch or clock that will complement your style.\",\n",

Becky Sharp (Reese Witherspoon) is a bright and ambitious girl born to a poor British family. Becky is determined to make something of herself however she can, and after accepting a job as a nanny for the children of the powerful and aristocratic Sir Pitt Crawley (Bob Hoskins), she wastes no time ingratiating herself with the family. Pretty Becky catches the eye of Crawley's handsome and eligible son Rawdon (James Purefoy), and becomes chummy with sharp-tongued Aunt Matilda (Eileen Atkins). Between the two of them, Becky is introduced to London's most exclusive social circle, where she becomes re-acquainted with Amelia Sedley (Romola Garai), a former school chum who is amused by Becky's efforts to scale the ladder of social influence. Becky weds Rawdon, but following initial happiness, the social and economic stability she dreamed of begins to collapse when he begins drowning his troubles in gambling and drink, and soon she turns to the powerful Marquess of Steyne (Gabriel Byrne) for support. Meanwhile, Amelia's fortunes fall even harder following the death of her husband.

Select the size of your heat source so that it is as close as possible to the base size of your pan. This will prevent energy loss and over heating of the handle. Gently pre-heat utensil on low setting for 2 - 3 minutes then add oil or liquid to the pan. Wooden, plastic, silicone or heat resistant nylon tools are recommended, to avoid scratching the enamel surface. Use a potholder or oven glove to lift metal handled pan from the stovetop or oven. Set hot pan on a Le Creuset trivet, board or cloth, not directly on unprotected counter tops. When using pan on ceramic or halogen stove tops, always lift pan (do not slide) to move. If a pan is ban ged against a hard surface or is dropped, it may chip or break. Oven-safe to 500 F and broiler-safe. To maintain the beauty of your pan's finish, hand-washing is recommended in warm sudsy water with a nylon brush or pad. Cool pan before washing in dishwasher or in hot soapy water. Do not leave to drain or put away while still damp. Remove stubborn food residues with a plastic or sponge scourer only -- do not use metal scourers or abrasive cleaners of any kind.\",\n",

Reissue.\\nVANITY FAIR, Thackeray\\'s panoramic, satirical saga of corruption at all levels of English society, was published in 1847 but set during the Napoleonic Wars. It chronicles the lives of two women who could not be more different: Becky Sharp, an orphan whose only resources are her vast ambitions, her native wit, and her loose morals; and her schoolmate Amelia Sedley, a typically naive Victorian heroine, the pampered daughter of a wealthy family. Becky\\'s fluctuating fortunes eventually bring her to an affair with Amelia\\'s dissolute husband; when he is killed at Waterloo, Amelia and her child are left penniless, while Becky and her husband Rawdon Crawley rise in the world, managing to lead a high life in London solely on the basis of their shrewdness. (The chapter entitled \"How to Live on Nothing\" is a classic.) Thackeray\\'s subtitle, \"A Novel Without a Hero,\" is understating the case; his view of humanity in this novel is distinctly bleak and deliberately antiheroic. Critics of the time misunderstood the book, decrying it as (among other things) vicious, vile, and odious. But VANITY FAIR has endured as one of the great comic novels of all time, and a landmark in the history of realism in fiction.',\n",

       " \"sleeping bags Big Agnes Bald Mountain Sleeping Bag: 18 Degree Synthetic Orange/Silver, Long/Left Zip Bald Mountain sounds like a scary place to visit (a vision of the future!) but it won't be nearly as frightening if you spend your nights in the Bald Mountain 18-Degree Synthetic Sleeping Bag from the hirsute cats at Big Agnes. You'll be warm even if all your hair falls out, courtesy of a contoured drawcord hood and mummy shape that increases warmth while decreasing weight. And courtesy, of course, of the synthetic Pinneco Core insulation that's wrapped in a tough nylon shell.\\n\\nUnlike down, Pinneco's warm even if it gets wet, but it's also breathable and uses a Core Screen layer that resists external moisture while actively drawing condensation from inside the bag, keeping you warm as a wolverine and dry as a sand worm all night. A no-draft collar and no-draft zipper lock out drafts (bet you didn't see that coming), while Insotect Tubic baffle construction uses vertically-baffled insulation to better conform to your body and provide superior loft and support. You can also mate together left- and right-zip bags if you feel the need for a doublewide.\",\n",

She may not have the natural advantages of her companion but she more than makes up for it with her wit, charm, deviousness and determination to make a success of herself whatever the cost. Vanity Fair is the story of Becky?셲 rise and fall as she gambles, manipulates and seduces her way through high society and the Napoleonic wars.\\n\\nVANITY FAIR, Thackeray\\'s panoramic, satirical saga of corruption at all levels of English society, was published in 1847 but set during the Napoleonic Wars. It chronicles the lives of two women who could not be more different: Becky Sharp, an orphan whose only resources are her vast ambitions, her native wit, and her loose morals; and her schoolmate Amelia Sedley, a typically naive Victorian heroine, the pampered daughter of a wealthy family. Becky\\'s fluctuating fortunes eventually bring her to an affair with Amelia\\'s dissolute husband; when he is killed at Waterloo, Amelia and her child are left penniless, while Becky and her husband Rawdon Crawley rise in the world, managing to lead a high life in London solely on the basis of their shrewdness. (The chapter entitled \"How to Live on Nothing\" is a classic.) Thackeray\\'s subtitle, \"A Novel Without a Hero,\" is understating the case; his view of humanity in this novel is distinctly bleak and deliberately antiheroic. Critics of the time misunderstood the book, decrying it as (among other things) vicious, vile, and odious. But VANITY FAIR has endured as one of the great comic novels of all time, and a landmark in the history of realism in fiction.\\n\\n    Genre: Juvenile Fiction, Fiction + Literature Themes\\n    Subgenre: Human Qualities + Behavior, Humorous Fiction, Types of Characters, Society + Social Issues, Literary Genres + Types of Novels, Family + Friendship, Historical / General\\n    Edition: Reprint\\n    Language: English\\n    Author: William Makepeace Thackeray , William M.
