(the chapter entitled \"how to live on nothing\" is a classic.) thackeray\\'s subtitle, \"a novel without a hero,\" is understating the case; his view of humanity in this novel is distinctly bleak and deliberately antiheroic. critics of the time misunderstood the book, decrying it as (among other things) vicious, vile, and odious. but vanity fair has endured as one of the great comic novels of all time, and a landmark in the history of realism in fiction.',\n",
